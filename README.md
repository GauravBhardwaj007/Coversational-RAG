Conversational AI System with RAG and Vector Database

Description: Developed a question-answering system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
Enabled accurate, context-aware responses by retrieving information from PDF documents using NLP-based vector embeddings and a vector database.

Implementation: Built with LangChain framework and powered by TinyLlama.

Impact: Enhances user experience by providing precise, document-based (In my case two sample pdfs on Climate change' answers.

Tools: Python, LangChain, TinyLlama, Vector Databases, NLP Libraries



# Fork the .ipynb file
# Run all the cells and use your own source (documents like pdf) for context based answers.
# tune the number of max tokens and tags, etc to play with accuracy and length of answers.
